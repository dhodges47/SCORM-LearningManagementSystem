                The anyN operator takes one or more sub-expressions each with a base-type of boolean and single cardinality. The result is a single boolean which is true if at least min of the sub-expressions are true and at most max of the sub-expressions are true. If more than n - min sub-expressions are false (where n is the total number of sub-expressions) or more than max sub-expressions are true then the result is false. If one or more sub-expressions are NULL then it is possible that neither of these conditions is satisfied, in which case the operator results in NULL. For example, if min is 3 and max is 4 and the sub-expressions have values {true,true,false,NULL} then the operator results in NULL whereas {true,false,false,NULL} results in false and {true,true,true,NULL} results in true. The result NULL indicates that the correct value for the operator cannot be determined.

                The ExtendedTextInteraction complexType is the container for information about an extendedText interaction. An extended text interaction is a blockInteraction that allows the candidate to enter an extended amount of text. The extendedTextInteraction must be bound to a response variable with baseType of string, integer or float. When bound to response variable with single cardinality a single string of text is required from the candidate. When bound to a response variable with multiple or ordered cardinality several separate text strings may be required, see maxStrings below.

                The GapMatchInteraction complexType is the container for the information about a gap match interaction. A gap match interaction is a block interaction that contains a number gaps that the candidate can fill from an associated set of choices. The candidate must be able to review the content with the gaps filled in context, as indicated by their choices. The gapMatchInteraction must be bound to a response variable with base-type directedPair and either single or multiple cardinality, depending on the number of gaps. The choices represent the source of the pairing and gaps the targets. Each gap can have at most one choice associated with it. The maximum occurrence of the choices is controlled by the matchMax attribute of gapChoice.

                GraphicGapMatchInteraction is the complexType for graphic gap match QTI interactions. A graphic gap-match interaction is a graphical interaction with a set of gaps that are defined as areas (hotspots) of the graphic image and an additional set of gap choices that are defined outside the image. The candidate must associate the gap choices with the gaps in the image and be able to review the image with the gaps filled in context, as indicated by their choices.

                The HotTextInteraction complexType is the container for information about a hotText interaction. The hottext interaction presents a set of choices to the candidate represented as selectable runs of text embedded within a surrounding context, such as a simple passage of text. Like choiceInteraction, the candidate's task is to select one or more of the choices, up to a maximum of maxChoices. The interaction is initialized from the defaultValue of the associated response variable, a NULL value indicating that no choices are selected (the usual case). The hottextInteraction must be bound to a response variable with a baseType of identifier and single or multiple cardinality.

                The InterpolationTable complexType is the container for interpolation information. An interpolationTable transforms a source float (or integer) by finding the first interpolationTableEntry with a sourceValue that is less than or equal to (subject to includeBoundary) the source value. For example, an interpolation table can be used to map a raw numeric score onto an identifier representing a grade. It may also be used to implement numeric transformations such as those from a simple raw score to a value on a calibrated scale.

A match interaction is a blockInteraction that presents candidates with two sets of choices and allows them to create associates between pairs of choices in the two sets, but not between pairs of choices in the same set. Further restrictions can still be placed on the allowable associations using the matchMax and matchGroup attributes of the choices. The matchInteraction must be bound to a response variable with base-type directedPair and either single or multiple cardinality.

                The mathOperator operator takes 1 or more sub-expressions which all have single cardinality and have numerical base-types. The trigonometric functions, sin, cos and tan, take one argument in radians, which evaluates to a single float. Other functions take one numerical argument. Further functions might take more than one numerical argument, e.g. atan2 (two argument arc tan). The result is a single float, except for the functions signum, floor and ceil, which return a single integer. If any of the sub-expressions is NULL, the result is NULL. If any of the sub-expressions falls outside the natural domain of the function called by mathOperator, e.g. log(0) or asin(2), then the result is NULL.

                The OutcomeProcessing complexType is the container for the outcome processing instructions. Outcome processing takes place each time the candidate submits the responses for an item (when in individual submission mode) or a group of items (when in simultaneous submission mode). It happens after any (item level) response processing triggered by the submission. The values of the test's outcome variables are always reset to their defaults prior to carrying out the instructions described by the outcomeRules. Because outcome processing happend each time the candidate submits responses the resulting values of the test-level outcomes may be used to activate test-level feedback during the test or to control the behaviour of subsequent parts through the use of preConditions and branchRules.

                The ResponseProcessing complexType is the container for response processing instructions. Response processing involves the application of a set of responseRules, including the testing of responseConditions and the evaluation of expressions involving the item variables. For delivery engines that are only designed to support very simple use cases the implementation of a system for carrying out this evaluation, conditional testing and processing may pose a barrier to the adoption of the specification.

                The roundTo operator takes one sub-expression which must have single cardinality and a numerical base-type. The result is a single float with the value nearest to that of the expression's value such that when converted to a decimal string it represents the expression rounded by the specified rounding method to the specified precision. If the sub-expression is NULL, then the result is NULL. If the sub-expression is INF, then the result is INF. If the sub-expression is -INF, then the result is -INF. If the argument is NaN, then the result is NULL. When rounding to n significant figures, the deciding digit is the (n+1)th digit counting from the first non-zero digit from the left in the number. If the deciding digit is 5 or greater, the nth digit is increased by 1 and all digits to its right are discarded; if the deciding digit is less than 5, all digits to the right of the nth digit are discarded. When rounding to n decimal places, the deciding digit is the (n+1)th digit counting to the right from the decimal point. If the deciding digit is 5 or greater, the nth digit is increased by 1 and all digits to its right are discarded; if the deciding digit is less than 5, all digits to the right of the nth digit are discarded.

                A rubric block identifies instructions to one or more of the actors that view the item or set of items (as per a section).

In other words, if an element is determined to be hidden then all of its content is hidden including conditionally visible elements for which the conditions are satisfied and that therefore would otherwise be visible.

                The TemplateConstraint complexType is the container for the constraints to be applied to a templateRule. A templateConstraint determines constraints on the binding of variables in the contained expression. The expression must have an effective baseType of boolean and single cardinality. At the runtime the template variables must be instantiated according to these constraints. Implementors need to be aware that some configurations of templateConstraint can cause an infinite loop. For that reason, the minimum supported maximum number of templateConstraint iterations is 100.

                The information in a TemplateDefault complexType is used to alter the default value of a template variable declared by the item based on an expression evaluated at test-level. The default value of a template variable in an item can be overridden based on the test context in which the template is instantiated. The value is obtained by evaluating an expression defined within the reference to the item at test level and which may therefore depend on the values of variables taken from other items in the test or from outcomes defined at test level itself.
